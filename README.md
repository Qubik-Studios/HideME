## Features
Use the build in commands to hide you from the Server.
This is a really simple Plugin and doesn't have the ability to hide you completely.
Builtin in this Plugin is a vanish management System for handling leaving. If you are in vanish and leave, you will stay vanished until the Server Restarts or you get out of vanish.


There are in total 3 diffrent Commands:
/vanish {player} | Permission: hideme.vanish.change | Hides the Player you have selected. Leave empty to hide yourself
/reloadskin {player} | Permission: hideme.reloadskin | Reloads the Skin from you or the selected Player if it won't load after being in Vanish
/revealvanished | Permission: hideme.revealvanished | shows a list with every vanished Player on the Server. Even when they are Offline.

## Note on Server Owners
You can use this Plugin on your Server as you like.
This is a Free Plugin, so please don't sell features to your users.
